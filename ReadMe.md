## Technology Stack

### Database
The database stores essential information related to user login credentials, facilitating secure access to the website's features.
#### Key Components:

1. **ElephantSQL PostgreSQL Database:**
   - The website utilizes ElephantSQL as a managed PostgreSQL database service.
   - PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database management system known for its reliability and robust feature set.

2. **Database Connectivity (database.py):**
   - The `get_database` function establishes a connection to the ElephantSQL-hosted PostgreSQL database using the provided username and password.
   - The `psycopg2` library serves as the PostgreSQL adapter for Python, enabling seamless interaction between the website and the database.

3. **Executing SQL Queries:**
   - Upon establishing a connection, SQL queries are executed using a cursor object obtained from the database connection.
   - The website executes SQL queries to retrieve, insert, update, or delete data stored in the PostgreSQL database.

4. **Fetching Results:**
   - After executing a query, the website fetches the results using methods like `fetchall` or `fetchone`, enabling data retrieval for further processing.
   - Results obtained from the database queries are processed and utilized within the website's functionalities, such as user authentication and data retrieval.

5. **Transaction Management:**
   - If the website performs data modification operations (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), it commits the transaction using the `commit` method to ensure changes are persisted to the database.
   - Proper transaction management helps maintain data integrity and consistency within the PostgreSQL database.

6. **Resource Cleanup:**
   - Once database interactions are completed, the website closes the cursor and database connection using the `close` method to release resources and prevent memory leaks.

**Functionality Overview:**

- **User Authentication:** The website verifies user login credentials by querying the PostgreSQL database for matching username-password combinations.
- **Data Retrieval:** Essential information, such as user details and application data, is retrieved from the database to populate web pages and facilitate user interactions.
- **Data Modification:** Authorized users can modify data stored in the database, such as updating application details or recording remarks, through secure interactions facilitated by the website.


### Frontend

Our medical claims project's frontend is built using React, providing a dynamic and user-friendly interface. React's component-based architecture enables modular development and seamless updates. With React's efficient state management, we deliver responsive and interactive user experiences. The combination of React and PostgreSQL forms a powerful platform for effective medical claims management.

### Backend

Our medical claims project's backend is powered by Flask, offering a lightweight and flexible framework for handling server-side logic. Flask's simplicity and extensibility facilitate rapid development and easy integration with our PostgreSQL database. With Flask's RESTful routing, we efficiently manage API endpoints for seamless communication between the frontend and the database. Together with React and PostgreSQL, Flask forms a robust and scalable solution for our medical claims management system.


## Routing and Navigation


The Medical Claims website utilizes React Router for client-side routing, enabling smooth navigation between different views and components. Below is an overview of the routing and navigation setup according to the provided code:

**Router Configuration**: The application is wrapped with the `<Router>` component from React Router, enabling routing functionality throughout the application.

```javascript
import {
  BrowserRouter as Router,
  Route,
  Routes,
} from "react-router-dom";
```

**Route Setup**: Routes are defined within the `<Routes>` component, specifying the URL path and the corresponding component to render.

```javascript
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<LandingPage />} />
  <Route path="/otp" element={<OTPForm />} />
  <Route path="/Signup" element={<Signup />} />
  {/* Additional routes */}
</Routes>
```

**Private Routes**: Certain routes are protected and accessible only to authenticated users. This is achieved using a higher-order component called `PrivateRoute`.

```javascript
<Route path="/Home" element={<PrivateRoute><Home /></PrivateRoute>} />
<Route path="/Pharmacist" element={<PrivateRoute><Pharmacist /></PrivateRoute>} />
{/* Additional private routes */}
```

**Nested Routes**: Some routes are nested within parent routes, indicating hierarchical relationships between different views or components.

```javascript
<Route path="/Home/Instructions" element={<PrivateRoute><Instructions /></PrivateRoute>} />
<Route path="/Page1/Page2" element={<PrivateRoute><Page2 /></PrivateRoute>} />
{/* More nested routes */}
```

**Dynamic Route Parameters**: Dynamic route parameters are used to handle variations in URLs, such as displaying specific application details based on the application ID.

```javascript
<Route path="/Home/ShowApplication/:id" element={<PrivateRoute><ShowApplication /></PrivateRoute>} />
<Route path="/Pharmacist/ShowApplicationToPharmaMed/:id" element={<PrivateRoute><ShowApplicationToPharmaMed /></PrivateRoute>} />
{/* More routes with dynamic parameters */}
```

**Fallback Route**: A fallback route is defined to handle any paths that do not match the specified routes, rendering an error page or default component.

```javascript
<Route path="*" element={<Errorpage />} />
```

## Visually representation through a flowchart.   
"We've developed a comprehensive flowchart on our website, showcasing the entire process of medical claims submission, approval, and subsequent actions. This flowchart illustrates who can apply, the sequential approval process involving different administrators, post-approval actions, and protocols for applications placed on hold. It serves as a visual roadmap, encapsulating the complete functionality of our website."



### Meaning of different color lines 
1. Orange Color Line: In the flowchart, the orange-colored line symbolizes the process wherein a user attempts to log in. Our system promptly verifies whether the login data already exists in our database. If a matching record is found, an OTP (One-Time Password) is dispatched for verification. However, if the data is not found, an error message is displayed, prompting the user to register first before proceeding.

2. Black Color Line: In the flowchart, the black-colored line symbolizes the login process for various users, including students, pharmacists, doctors, junior accountants, assessing officers, registrars, and directors. Each user accesses their respective portal by logging in with their unique email IDs, which are pre-existing in our database. Upon successful login, each user is directed to their designated portal.

3. Yellow Color Line: In the flowchart, the yellow line signifies the administrative process of reviewing applications submitted by students. Each administrator evaluates the applications within their jurisdiction. Following deliberation, they decide whether to approve the application or place it on hold, accompanied by any remarks if necessary.

4. Blue Color Line: In the flowchart, the blue line denotes the hierarchical passing of applications from one administrator to another after initial approval. This indicates a sequential flow wherein the application progresses through different levels of authority for further assessment or approval. For instance, the application may first be approved by a pharmacist, then forwarded to a doctor, and subsequently to other administrators as per the established hierarchy.

5. Green Color Line: In the flowchart, the green-colored line represents a two-way process involving the resolution of application issues. When an administrator identifies missing information or requires additional details, they place the application on hold and provide remarks detailing the necessary updates. Subsequently, the status update is communicated to the student portal. The student then addresses the remarks by providing the required information, allowing the application to continue from where it was placed on hold, rather than starting the process anew. This two-way interaction streamlines the application process and ensures efficient resolution of issues.
